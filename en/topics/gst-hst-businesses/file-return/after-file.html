<h2 id="h_1">What happens after you file</h2>


<p>Once we process your GST/HST return, we will send you a <strong>notice of assessment</strong>, if one of the following statements is true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are owed a refund or rebate</li>
  <li>The amount you owe is more than what you paid</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_3">Checking your return status</h3>
<p>To view the status and the details of a previously filed GST/HST return, sign in to your online <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA account</a>.</p>
<p>In My Business Account or Represent a client, you can see your recently filed items in a <strong>Progress tracker</strong> on the overview page. To find out what different status messages mean and what files can be tracked in your account, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/progress-tracker.html">learn more about the progress tracker</a>.</p>
<p>You can also find the details of previously filed, upcoming or overdue GST/HST returns in your account:</p>
<ol class="lst-steps">
    <li>In your CRA account, select <strong>GST/HST</strong> from the left menu</li>
    <li>Choose your RT number</li>
    <li>On your account overview page under <strong>Returns</strong>, find a list of your expected and filed GST/HST returns</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_1_1">Notice of assessment</h3>
<p>If you have registered for a CRA account, you can sign up for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/online-mail-reduce-your-cost-doing-business-saving-time-online.html">email notifications from the CRA</a>. 
<p>Email notifications from the CRA let you know when important changes are made on your account and when you have mail to view in your CRA account, such as your notice of assessment.</p>
<p>If you are not signed up for email notifications, we will mail you a paper copy.</p>
<p>Your notice of assessment may include details about penalties and interest you were charged. </p>
<p>Refer to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-return/reporting-requirements-deadlines/penalties-gst-hst-returns.html">GST/HST filing penalties</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/remit-pay-gst-hst-collected.html#toc_4">Interest on GST/HST amounts owing</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_1_2">When to expect your refund</h3>
<p>You can claim a refund if your <strong>net tax</strong> (line 109 of your GST/HST return) is a negative amount.</p>
<p>In most cases, we process GST/HST returns within 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Your refund may be delayed if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You did not include all necessary information</li>
  <li>You did not complete your return correctly</li>
</ul>
<p>If you signed up for direct deposit, we will deposit your refund directly into your bank account.</p>
<p>Refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">Direct deposit</a></p>
<p>If you are owed interest on your refund, we will pay it based on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rate</a>. Interest is compounded daily on an overpayment <strong>up to and including</strong> the day the overpayment is refunded or applied to another debt.</p>
<h4>Refund holds</h4>
<p>If you have any missing returns or unpaid amounts under other acts administered by the CRA, we can hold your GST/HST refund or rebate until you have filed your required returns and paid your outstanding amounts.</p>
<p>These acts include:</p>
<ul class="colcount-sm-2">
  <li>Excise Tax Act</li>
  <li>Excise Act 2001</li>
  <li>Income Tax Act</li>
  <li>Air Travellers Security Charge Act</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a sole proprietor or part of a partnership, we will also hold your personal income tax refund.</p>
<p>We can also use any GST/HST refund or rebate that you are entitled to receive to pay your outstanding amount.</p>
<h2 id="h_2">Pay your balance</h2>
<p>If you owe money, you must pay your balance before the deadline passes.</p>
<p>Refer to: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/remit-pay-gst-hst-collected.html">Remit (pay) the GST/HST</a></p>
<p>Most payments can be made electronically. If you want to pay in person or by mail, you must use a personalized <strong>remittance voucher</strong> (a payment slip): <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/request-payment-forms-remittance-vouchers.html">Remittance vouchers and payment forms</a></p>

<!--<h2 id="h_4">Fix a mistake on a return</h2>-->
<h2 id="h_4">Change a return you already filed</h2>
<p>If you made a mistake on a GST/HST return you already filed, <strong>do not file a new return</strong>. Instead, make your changes in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <h4 class="mrgn-tp-sm text-muted">Mail your adjustment information<span class="wb-inv">: Option 2</span></h4>
    <p>Send a letter to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax centre</a>. The letter must be signed by the business owner or an authorized representative and must contain:</p>

      <li>The reporting period you need to correct</li>
      <li>The corrected amounts for each line on your return</li>
      <li>The name and phone number of someone we can contact if needed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Adjust a rebate</summary>
<p>Public service bodies can electronically ask for an adjustment to an assessed <strong>PSB rebate</strong> claim electronically in their CRA account:
    <ul>      
        <li>Sign in to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA account</a></li>

<h4 id="h_4_2">Make a voluntary disclosure</h4>
<p>The Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP) allows you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fix incorrect or incomplete information</li>
  <li>Report information you did not include in a previous return</li>
</ul>
<p>You may apply to the VDP to be granted relief on applicable penalties or prosecution. If you qualify, you will only have to pay the tax owed and any interest.</p>

<h2 id="h_5">Preparing for reviews and audits</h2>
<!--<h3 id="h_5_1">What you need to keep</h3>-->
<p>When you file electronically, keep a copy of your return and any other information you used to prepare it.</p>
<p>To learn more about what other documents you need to keep, refer to: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/calculate-prepare-report/gst-hst-records-keep.html">GST/HST records to keep</a></p>
<h3 id="h_5_2">How to prepare for a post-assessment review</h3>
<p>We may contact you for a post-assessment review to verify the amounts on your return. This is different from an audit.</p>
<p>During this review, we may ask you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain the amounts reported on your return</li>
  <li>Provide supporting documents like receipts or invoices</li>
</ul>
<p>If needed, we will make adjustments to your return.</p>

<h3 id="h_5_3">How to prepare for an audit</h3>
<p>A tax audit can be overwhelming. Learning more about audits can help:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What tax audits are and why we do them</li>
  <li>What happens during an audit</li>
  <li>What your responsibilities are</li>
  <li>What your rights are</li>
