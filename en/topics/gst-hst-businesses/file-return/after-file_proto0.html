<h2>What to expect after you file</h2>

<p>Once we receive and process your your GST/HST return, we will send you a notice of assessment if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We owe you a refund or rebate</li>
  <li>Your amount owing is more than the payment you made</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a remaining amount owing, we will also send you a remittance voucher you can use to <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/remit-pay-gst-hst-collected.html">pay your balance</a>.</p>
<h3>Notices of assessment</h3>
<p>If we send you a notice of assessment and you are registered to receive email notifications, we will send a notification that there is mail for you in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>. If you are not registered for email notifications, we will mail you your notice of assessment.</p>
<p>Your notice of assessment may include details on Penalies and interest. For more information, refer to: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-return/reporting-requirements-deadlines/penalties-gst-hst-returns.html">GST/HST – Penalties and interest</a></p>
<h3>When to expect your refund</h3>
<p>You can claim a refund if your net tax (<strong>line 109</strong> of your GST/HST return) for a reporting period is a negative amount.</p>
<p>Generally, we process a GST/HST return within 4 weeks.</p>
<p>If you did <strong>not</strong> include all the necessary information or complete your return correctly, the processing of your refund could be delayed.</p>
<p>You may receive your refund deposited directly into your bank account. For more information on how to enroll for direct deposit, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">Direct deposit – Canada Revenue Agency</a>.</p>
<p>The CRA pays refund interest according to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rate</a>. Refund interest is compounded daily on an overpayment up to and including the day the overpayment is refunded, repaid, or applied. The calculation of interest we pay <strong>ends </strong>on the day the refund is paid or applied.</p>
<h4>Refund holds</h4>
<p>If you have to file any returns under the Excise Tax Act, the Excise Act 2001, the Income Tax Act, or the Air Travellers Security Charge Act, but have not done so, we will hold any GST/HST refund or rebate you are entitled to until you have filed your required returns and paid your outstanding amounts. If you are a sole proprietor or partnership, we will also hold your personal income tax refund.</p>
<p>We can also use any GST/HST refund or rebate that you are entitled to receive to pay your outstanding amount.</p>
<p>You may receive your refund deposited directly into your bank account. For more information on how to enroll for direct deposit, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">Direct deposit – Canada Revenue Agency</a>.</p>

<h2>Pay your balance</h2>
<p>If there is an amount owing, we will send you <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/request-payment-forms-remittance-vouchers.html#rc159">Form RC159, Remittance Voucher – Amount Owing – personalized</a> with your notice. Use this form to pay any outstanding amount. Form RC159 is not available on our website. This form is only provided in a pre-printed format. To order this personalized form, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>, or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>.</p>
<h2>Check a previous return</h2>
<p>To view the status and the details of a previously filed GST/HST return, sign in to your online CRA account <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">CRA account</a> to access your business account.</p>
<p>You may view the status and the details of a previously filed GST/HST return using <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>. You will also be able to view upcoming and overdue GST/HST returns by using the same digital service.</p>
<h2>What to do if you made a mistake</h2>
<h3>Change a previous return</h3>
<p>To change a return you have already sent, do <strong>not </strong>file another return. Instead, go to :</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also send a letter to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">tax centre</a> indicating your GST/HST business number, the GST/HST reporting period to be amended and the corrected amounts per line number on your GST/HST return. Make sure the letter is signed by the owner, or an authorized representative for whom the CRA have the correct level of authorization and includes the name and telephone number of a person the CRA can contact if needed.</p>
<h3>Make a voluntary disclosure</h3>
<p>The Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP) allows you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fix inaccurate or incomplete information</li>
  <li>Disclose information you had not previously reported to us</li>
</ul>
<p>You may apply to the VDP to avoid penalties and prosecution. If you are eligible, you will only have to pay the taxes owing and interest.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html">Voluntary Disclosures Program</a>.</p>
<h2>Prepare for reviews and audits</h2>
<h3>What you need to keep</h3>
<p>When you file electronically, you should also keep a working copy of your return for your records. It, and any other information you use to prepare your return, are subject to audit and must be retained for verification purposes.</p>
<p>To learn more about what other documents you need to keep, refer to:  <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/calculate-prepare-report/gst-hst-records-keep.html">Records to keep</a></p>
<h3>Prepare for a post-assessment review</h3>
<p>To make sure you reported certain amounts correctly on your GST/HST return, we may contact you for a GST/HST post-assessment review. This is not a GST/HST audit.</p>
<p>During this review, we will ask you to provide a brief explanation to validate the amounts on your GST/HST return. In some cases, you may be asked to provide supporting documents for these amounts such as receipts or a bill of sale. Adjustments may be made to your GST/HST return, if required.</p>
<p>There are some common adjustments that are made to correct reporting errors on GST/HST returns. Read about <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/complete-file-return-business/file-return.html#toc4">common mistakes to avoid when completing your GST/HST return</a>.</p>
<h3>Prepare for an audit</h3>
<p>Being audited can be overwhelming. The following questions will help you prepare for a GST/HST audit and understand how the tax audit process works:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do we audit and what is a tax audit?</li>
  <li>What are your responsibilities and what happens during an audit?</li>
  <li>What are your rights?</li>
</ul>
