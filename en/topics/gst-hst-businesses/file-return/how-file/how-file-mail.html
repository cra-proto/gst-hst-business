<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">By mail<span class="wb-inv"> – File your GST/HST return</span></h1>

 <p>To file a paper return, you can either mail your GST/HST return to the address on your return, or bring your paper return to a participating financial institution.</p>

  <ul>
      <li><a href="#h_1">What you can file by mail</a></li>
    <li><a href="#h_2">Get a GST/HST return form</a></li>

  </ul>
</nav>
    <h2 id="h_1">What you can file by mail</h2>
<p>All GST/HST returns and forms can be filed by mail to the CRA. However, most returns must be filed electronically in order to avoid a penalty.</p>
     <h3>Mandatory electronic filing</h3>
      <p>Only charities, selected listed financial institutions, and registrants with an approved exemption can file by mail without a penalty.</p>
<p>Refer to: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-return/how-file.html#h_1">Mandatory electronic filing</a>.</p>
<p>To file electronically instead of filing by mail, choose <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-return/how-file.html#h_2">another filing method that works for you</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="h_2">Get a GST/HST return form</h2>
<p>You do <strong>not</strong> need a return form if you are filing electronically. However, to help you calculate and complete your taxes, you can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/migration/cra-arc/tx/bsnss/tpcs/gst-tps/bspsbch/rtrns/wrkngcp-eng.pdf">download a working copy of the GST/HST return (PDF, 116 KB)</a>. Do not mail us your working copy.</p>

<h3>Request a new GST/HST return form</h3>
<p>Each GST/HST return is personalized to you. You <strong>cannot download</strong> a blank return outside of your account.</p>
<p>To request a paper GST/HST return <span class="nowrap">(Form GST34-2</span> or GST62), you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/cjcf/fpos-scfp/pub/rdr?request_locale=en_CA">Make an online request for a GST62 form</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/file-return/contact-us.html">Contact us by phone</a></li>
        </ul>
<p>If you normally file by mail, the CRA will automatically mail you a personalized <span class="nowrap">Form GST34-2</span> return package that includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An information sheet with your reporting periods and due dates</li>
      <li>An access code for filing your returns electronically outside of your CRA account</li>
      <li>Remittance vouchers to use if you make your payments at your financial institution</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="h_3">Where to send your return</h2>
<p>Mail your GST/HST return to the <strong>address printed on your return</strong>.</p>
<p>You may need to mail us supporting documents or other <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/forms-publications.html">GST/HST rebate applications or elections forms</a>.</p>
<p>Refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/tax-services-offices-tax-centres.html">Find a CRA mailing address</a></p>

<h3 id="h_3_1">Filing in person at a financial institution</h3>
<p>Most GST/HST registrants who file on paper can bring their return to a participating financial institution to file it.</p>
    <p>You <strong>cannot</strong> file in person at a participating financial institution if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are claiming a refund</li>
      <li>You are filing a nil return</li>
      <li>You offset the amount owing on your return with a rebate or refund</li>
    </ul>
