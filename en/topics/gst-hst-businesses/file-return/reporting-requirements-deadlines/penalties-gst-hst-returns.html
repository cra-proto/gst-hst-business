      <p>You <strong>cannot</strong> claim an income tax deduction for any penalty paid or payable for failing to file a GST/HST return.</p>
        <h3>Additional penalties for financial institutions</h3>
        <p>If you are a financial institution who is also required to file <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst111.html">Form GST111, Financial Institution GST/HST Annual Information Return</a>, there are additional penalties associated with failures to properly report information on that return. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4419.html">Guide RC4419, Financial Institution GST/HST Annual Information Return</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="ntrst">Interest on late or incorrect payments</h2>
      <p>In addition to filing penalties, you may be charged interest if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have an overdue balance owing on a return</li>
        <li>Make a late or insufficient instalment payment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Refer to: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/gst-hst-business/en/topics/gst-hst-businesses/remit-pay-gst-hst-collected.html#toc_4">How and when interest applies to GST/HST remittances</a></p>
      
      <!--<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="ntrst">Find out how and when interest applies</h2>
    <p>We charge interest if you make late or insufficient payments. Depending on the debt, the interest charged is either <strong>arrears interest </strong>or<strong> instalment interest</strong>.</p>
    <p>We pay interest on an <strong>overpayment or refund</strong> of net tax claimed on a GST/HST return.</p>

        <li><a href="#instalment">Instalment interest</a></li>
        <li><a href="#refund">Refund interest</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="arrears">Arrears interest</h3>
    <p>We charge arrears interest on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any overdue balance owing on a GST/HST return</li>
        <li>Any other overdue GST/HST amount that you have to remit to the Receiver General</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The interest rate is determined every three months in accordance with the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rate</a> compounded daily.</p>
    <h4>Calculate arrears interest</h4>
    <p>If you have an amount owing, you can view a balance that includes interest calculated to a date you select in your CRA account:

            <li>Sign in to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">your CRA account</a></li>
            <li>Choose <strong>View and pay account balance</strong></li>
            <li>Choose <strong>Calculate future balance</strong></li>
        </ol>

    <h3 id="instalment">Instalment interest</h3>
    <p>If the instalment payments you make are equal to one quarter of your net tax from your last fiscal year and you make those payments in full and on time, we will not charge instalment interest, even if your net tax for the year is more than the instalments you made.</p>
    <p>Interest on the part of any instalment payment that was not paid or that was paid late will be charged <strong>at the end</strong> of the fiscal year.</p>
    <p>If you realize at any time during the fiscal year that you paid less than your required instalment payment or that you did not pay an instalment on time, you can reduce or eliminate your instalment interest by overpaying your next instalment payment or by paying it early.</p>

    <p>Instalment interest is calculated beginning the day after the instalment payment was due and ending on the <strong>earlier</strong> of the following dates:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The day the overdue instalment amount is paid (including any accrued interest)</li>
        <li>The day your net tax owing for the year is due (although other interest still applies if there is an overdue balance on your GST/HST return).</li>
    </ul>

        <summary>Example of instalment interest calculation</summary>
        <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
            <p>Your net tax for the 2020 fiscal year was $4,000. You estimate that your net tax for 2021 would be $3,200. You chose to make quarterly instalments of $1,000 each based on your 2020 net tax and you paid each one by its due date.</p>
            <p>At the end of 2021 you calculated your net tax and it was actually $5,500. Since your 2021 instalment payments were equal to one quarter of your net tax for 2020 you will not be charged instalment interest. You have to pay the balance of $1,500 by the due date for your net tax for the fiscal year.</p>
        </div>
    </details>
</div>


    <h3 id="refund">Refund interest</h3>
    <p>We will pay you interest, compounded daily, on an overpayment or refund of net tax claimed on a GST/HST return <strong>beginning</strong> from the <strong>later</strong> of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>30 days after the day you file the return in which you claim the refund</li>
        <li>30 days after the day after the end of the reporting period that is covered by that return</li>
        <li>The date of the payment that created the overpayment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The calculation of interest we pay <strong>ends</strong> on the day the refund is paid or applied. The interest rate is determined every three months in accordance with the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rate</a> compounded daily.</p>
