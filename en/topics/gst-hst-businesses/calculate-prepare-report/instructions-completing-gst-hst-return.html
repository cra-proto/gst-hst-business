<h4>Builders of new or substantially-renovated housing</h4>
<p>Certain builders must file their GST/HST returns using GST/HST NETFILE only. Other builders may have to file their GST/HST returns using another electronic method. To find out which method you must use, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/gi-099.html">GST/HST Info Sheet <span class="nowrap">GI-099</span>, Builders and Electronic Filing Requirements</a>.</p>
<p>If you must use GST/HST NETFILE only, follow the instructions in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/gi-118.html">GST/HST Info Sheet GI-118, Builders and GST/HST NETFILE</a>, to complete your return instead of the instructions on this web page.</p>

          <p>Occasionally, you may make a credit sale that becomes uncollectible and you write off the uncollectible amount in your records as a bad debt.</p>
          <p>If the bad debt is part of an amount that you have already included on your GST/HST return and you remitted that amount, you can recover the GST/HST as a tax <strong>adjustment</strong> on <span class="nowrap">line 107</span> (or line 108 if you are filing using GST/HST TELEFILE). You have to make the tax adjustment in a reporting period that is <strong>within 4 years </strong>of the reporting period in which you wrote off the bad debt in your records. <strong>Do not </strong>adjust the return in which you originally reported the GST/HST on the sale.</p>
          <p>The debt has to be written off as a bad debt in your records, and you have to deal with the person at arm's length.</p>
          <p>Use the following formula to calculate the tax adjustment:</p>
          <p><strong>A × (B ÷ C)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A</strong> is the GST/HST payable on the sale.</p>
          <p><strong>B</strong> is the total unpaid amount that was written off as a bad debt, including GST/HST and applicable provincial sales taxes (PST).</p>
