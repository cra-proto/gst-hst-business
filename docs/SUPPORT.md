## Basic GCWeb setup instructions

For the GCWeb/Jekyll setup to function a `_config.yml` file must saved at the repositories root. Examples: [GCWeb _config.yml](https://github.com/wet-boew/gcweb-jekyll/blob/master/_config.yml), [core-prototype _config.yml](https://github.com/cra-design/core-prototype/blob/main/_config.yml)

## Page template options

- The `Edit button` on the banner toggles an instance **TinyMCE** on and off allowing editing of the live page **Note:** Any changes you save with this method are only saved for yourself so if you want to make any permanent changes you'll still need to update those via GitHub
- The `GitHub button` on the banner will take you to the the source page on GitHub  
- All pages links and forms that direct outside of the repository to will automatically be replaced with links to the **exit intent page**

## Custom GitHub options

- The data attribute `data-exit="false"` can be used on `<a>` and `<form>` tags directed outside of the GitHub domain so that replacement links are not generated to direct them automatically through the **exit intent page**
- Link overrides can be added to the [exit-link-excludes.json](https://github.com/cra-design/gst-hst-business/blob/main/_data/exitlinkexcludes.json) file. If there is only an `origin` link and no `destination` link then all occurrences of the link to that page will be excluded from redirects to the **exit intent page**. If there is both an `origin` link and a `destination` link then all occurrences of the `origin` link will be redirected to the `destination` page
